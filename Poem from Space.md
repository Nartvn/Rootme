Đây là 1 bài tôi thấy khá hay khi mà tìm trong ký tự trắng đặc biệt.
khi tải file về tôi được 1 đoạn như sau:
```The Charge of the Light Brigade    	 	  	 
Lord Alfred Tennyson 
1854 	
      			 	
Half a league, half a league,	    
Half a league onward, 	
All in the valley of Death       
Rode the six hundred.	    
"Forward, the Light Brigade! 	
Charge for the guns!" he said:      	 	
Into the valley of Death	    
Rode the six hundred. 	
"Forward, the Light Brigade!"      	  			
Was there a man dismayed?	  	 
Not though the soldier knew 	
Some one had blundered:      		   
Their's not to make reply,	    
Their's not to reason why, 	
Their's but to do and die:      	 		 
Into the valley of Death	    
Rode the six hundred. 	
      	  	  
Cannon to right of them,	  	 
Cannon to left of them, 	
Cannon in front of them      	   	
Volleyed and thundered;	    
Stormed at with shot and shell, 	
Boldly they rode and well,      		 			
Into the jaws of Death,	  	 
Into the mouth of Hell 	
Rode the six hundred.      	    		
	    
Flashed all their sabres bare, 	
Flashed as they turned in air      	     	
Sabring the gunners there,	  	 
Charging an army, while 	
All the world wondered:      	 		  
Plunged in the battery-smoke	    
Right through the line they broke; 	
Cossack and Russian      		  
Reeled from the sabre-stroke	  	 
Shattered and sundered. 	
Then they rode back, but not,      			 	
Not the six hundred.	    
 	
Cannon to right of them,      				  
Cannon to left of them,	  	 
Cannon behind them 	
Volleyed and thundered;      	 				
Stormed at with shot and shell,	    
While horse and hero fell, 	
They that had fought so well      		    
Came through the jaws of Death	  	 
Back from the mouth of Hell, 	
All that was left of them,      	  	 	 
Left of six hundred.	    
 	
When can their glory fade?      			  		
O the wild charge they made!	  	 
All the world wondered. 	
Honour the charge they made!  
Honour the Light Brigade,
Noble six hundred!
